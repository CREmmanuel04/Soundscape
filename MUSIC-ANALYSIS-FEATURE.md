## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Spring Boot)

#### New Controller: `MusicAnalysisController.java`
```java
@GetMapping("/music-analysis") // Main page
@GetMapping("/api/music-analysis") // AJAX endpoint for data
@GetMapping("/api/recently-played") // Recently played tracks
```

#### Enhanced Service: `SpotifyService.java`
New methods added:
- `getUserTopTracks()` - Detailed track information
- `getUserTopArtistsDetailed()` - Artists with genre analysis
- `getUserMusicAnalysis()` - Comprehensive analysis combining all data
- `getRecentlyPlayed()` - Recent listening activity

#### Spotify API Endpoints Used:
- `/v1/me/top/artists` - Top artists (short_term, medium_term, long_term)
- `/v1/me/top/tracks` - Top tracks (short_term, medium_term, long_term)  
- `/v1/me/player/recently-played` - Recently played tracks

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

#### Template: `music-analysis.html`
- Modern dark theme consistent with app design
- Responsive grid layout
- Interactive charts using Chart.js
- AJAX data loading for smooth user experience
- Tab-based navigation for different time ranges

#### Key JavaScript Functions:
- `loadMusicAnalysis()` - Fetches comprehensive user data
- `displayGenres()` - Shows genre breakdown with chart
- `createGenreChart()` - Chart.js doughnut chart
- `displayArtists(timeRange)` - Artist grid for selected period
- `displayTracks(timeRange)` - Track list for selected period
- `displayRecentlyPlayed()` - Recent activity feed

## Data Analysis Logic

### Genre Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
// Weight recent listening more heavily
shortTerm genres √ó 3 + mediumTerm genres √ó 2 + longTerm genres √ó 1
// Results in more accurate current taste representation
```

### Time Range Definitions (Spotify API)
- **short_term**: Last 4 weeks
- **medium_term**: Last 6 months  
- **long_term**: All time (several years)
